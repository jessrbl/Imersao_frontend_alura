## Enhancement

Details from the Spotify website that were not covered in the classes but which I chose to include in the code:

- [X] Added scrolling in the sidebar so that the podcast section can become visible when scrolling the scroll bar.
- [X] Included a *container__links* class to include all the links listed in the sidebar of the Spotify page (the project only includes the *cookies* link).
- [X] Added effects on the sidebar buttons and the footer button.
- [X] Added smooth color transition effect on the sidebar links (home, search, and library).
